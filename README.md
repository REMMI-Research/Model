VRENAR &amp; Remote Me Project Model

This repository contains the xmi code of the combined VRENAR and Remote me UML model, as well as the associated Matlab Simulink models and supporting materials.

It should be noted that the Simulink toolset used here is under the personal student license of F. Bott, for the completion of the Remote-me PhD project. To date, that project extending back to 2014 before academic phase, is, and has always been unfunded by any other means than the personal resources of said author, which are on course to deplete to zero very soon with no other change. Successful completion of Remote-me is absolutely dependent on successful fundraising. Remote-me is part of the VRENAR non-profit REMMI Research CIC venture, and successful research fundraising is a recognised skill contributing towards the qualification of PhD. Thus we see the use of the student licensed Matlab Simulink toolset as used here being entirely within the scope of the student license.
